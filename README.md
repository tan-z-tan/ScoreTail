## What is ScoreTail?

ScoreTail is a web-based music score editor built for playing, learning, and creating music together.

Open a classic from our **public domain library**, add your own annotations, or start a fresh score and invite others to join in — all in real time, right in your browser. Whether you're rehearsing with a band, teaching a class, or just exploring music with friends, ScoreTail makes sheet music something you can share and enjoy together.
